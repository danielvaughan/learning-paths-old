# What is a Learning Path?

A Learning Path is a curated collection of publically available resources recommended to those with the goal to develop competency in a specific subject with support of a Community of Practice.

## Who Creates a Learning Path?

A Learning Path is intially created by existing practioners proficient in the subject area and refined with feedback from those following the path.

## What does a Learning Path Contain?

A Learning Path has three sections:

* Objectives of the Learning Paths \(What\)

  * A clearly defined goal
  * A justification from the practioners of the value of achieving the goal
  * Details of the specific learning areas
  * An estimate of the time required to work through the recommended resources

  * A method of measuring success

* Details of the practitioners who curate the learning path and how to engage with the Community of Practice \(Who\)

* Recommended resources to achieve the objectives of the learning path \(How\)

  * A mapping between the resources and specific learning area
    * For example chapters of a book to a learning area

## What are the Prequisits for Following a Learning Path?

The learning path must give enough information to enable a potential learner to identify:

* A strong reason for wanting to achieve the goal of the learning path
* An understanding of the relevance of the goal to their own objectives

* A high level of self belief in the achievability of the goal by a chosen date
